#### What is it?
The latest version of uMSX Pro Rev.3.79 is newly launched with sufficient stock. I hope that everyone can easily own 1ChipMSX and get the best MSX2+ experience!  
It originated from the va-de-retro retro computer forum.   
The uMSX is a MSX2+ FPGA implementation that basically mimics the Zemmix (one of the first FPGA based MSX2+ one chip MSX computers commercially available).   
I think uMSX has two meanings:  
1.uMSX is a clone of 1ChipMSX. In order to reduce PCB manufacturing costs, BCH chose to divide the PCB into a mainboard and a card slot board, and the size of each PCB is within 10*10cm. I very much agree with this design idea.  
2. "Your MSX", 1ChipMSX belongs not only to you and me, but also to everyone. The FPGA and hardware design are completely open source, so everyone can build one for themselves.   
uMSX Rev3.7 PCB original design by BCH.  
Gerber to PCB conversion (reverse engineering) by Null.  
The acrylic shell is manufactured by Xiaohao Studio.  
Motherboard PCB modification + optimization by Denjhang, Null.  
Card slot version modified + optimized by Denjhang, BH2VGM.  

The VHDL used is the well known KDL PLD implementation for the MSX2+ used by the vast majority of the FPGA based MSX computers known. The uMSX uses the first generation of the KDL VHDL source, also known by esemsx.  

Based on the already obsolete (but relatively easy to find) Altera EP1C12 FPGA (specifically the EP1C12Q240C8N), the uMSX uses SMD based components (and a few PTH) in a nice compact form factor. It uses the 4 megabit EPCS4 active serial configuration flash memory to host the firmware and configure the FPGA chip at each time the circuit turns on.  

A MT48LC16M16A2 SRAM chip offers memory for the computer, which also uses a few other components to implement the clock logic (NC7WV04P6X inverter and 21.47727 basic PTH crystal oscillator) and a 953B voltage detector and reset IC.  

Heavily based on 0603 SMT resistance arrays, and other 0805 SMT components, the uMSX is a compact little OCM MSX that can be used to evolve your SMD soldering skills, challenge your knowledge of modern electronics applied to retro computing, and give you a lot of fun through the journey.  


#### Why did you make it?
Soldering chips like EP1C12Q240C8N is very difficult, but you can easily find a soldering foundry in China, which ensures the yield rate of my various products.  

The uMSX Pro Rev.3.7 I made is based on the uMSX Rev.3.5 of the vdr forum, which features a translucent acrylic case, and restores the deleted JoyPort 2, USB Wi-Fi, USB keyboard port, and I also designed a Conversion board, which can convert the VGA port of uMSX to S-Video and RGB. Buying uMSX Pro Rev.3.7 now will give you a 5V DC power supply, 1GB MicroSD (built-in system files), two MD controllers, two JoyMega, and a USB Wi-Fi dongle, making it truly ready to use out of the box. I also sell PS/2 or USB keyboards for uMSX if needed.  
#### What makes it special?  
MSX2+ Compatibility: Reproducing the MSX2+ architecture, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of software and games.
Expanded Memory Options: Choose between 2MB or 4MB of mapped RAM, providing users with flexibility for diverse computing needs and applications.  
9958 Video Display Processor (VDP): Incorporating the 9958 VDP for sharp graphics and improved visual performance, delivering an authentic MSX experience.  
FM and SCC Sound Capabilities: Featuring FM synthesis and SCC sound to reproduce the iconic audio characteristics of MSX systems, enhancing the overall gaming and multimedia experience.  
Programmable Sound Generator (PSG): Including the original PSG for standard MSX audio output.  
Keyboard Compatibility: Supporting PS/2 keyboards with the option for USB keyboards, providing users with a choice for their preferred input device.  
MicroSD Card Support: Integrating a microSD card slot for convenient storage and easy access to files, games, and software.  
MSX Cartridge Slots: Equipped with two MSX cartridge slots, allowing users to explore a vast library of MSX cartridges for an extended range of applications and games.  
Dual Joystick Ports: Featuring two joystick ports for multiplayer gaming and compatibility with classic MSX peripherals.
Wireless Network Support: Incorporating wireless network support through the ESP8266, enabling online connectivity and expanding the possibilities for networked applications.  
12V Cartridge Lines: Providing dedicated 12V lines for cartridges, ensuring compatibility with a variety of peripherals and accessories.  
After I modified and optimized it, I added many functions:  
1.Fix the power switch on the motherboard and use a reliable self-locking switch to get rid of the instability caused by the two pin headers of version 3.5.  
2.WI-FI dongle (support 2.4G wireless Internet access),  
3.USB keyboard interface (PS2 protocol),  
4.The second handle interface (JoyStick Port 2),  
5.MSX analog RGB video interface,  S-Video Output   
6.Two upright MSX expansion card slots with dust covers.    
7. Add a pre-audio amplifier to support volume adjustment    
8. Add the power filter IB0505S to make the sound quality better.   
9. Restore S-Video port and experience retro videos.  
10. Self-ejecting SD card slot for better experience.  
11. The interface layout has been improved. Compared with the original uMSX Rev.3.7, the VGA interface position is more reasonable (at the rear).  
12. Improved VGA display quality and avoided color deviation and interference.  
And I designed the acrylic case to integrate the motherboard and the card slot.Getting rid of the exposed PCB and handle connection ribbons makes this project a little more serious.  
By default, this product comes with an assembled acrylic case,And also comes with the following accessories:    
1.a DC 5V power supply  
2.a 1GB Micro SD. Among them, Micro SD will have built-in OCM BIOS and various system files, 
so that it can be used out of the box.    
MegaDrive controller with a Joymega, WI-FI dongle needs to be purchased additionally.  
uMSX supports the use of 4GB MicroSD as a hard drive. I will pre-install the sofarun game browser. You can easily select games without coding. And it has built-in scc flashrom and floppy drive emulator, you can play various 2M ROM large-capacity games and multi-disk games without any problem. Multi-disk games switch disks via keyboard hotkeys. So just one umsx is needed and you don't need any additional msx cartridges to play all MSX, MSX2, MSX2+ games.
